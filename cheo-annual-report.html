      <h2 class="micro push-none">The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Redesign the 2014 CHEO Annual report to reflect the organization’s brand and values in an appropriate and visually interesting manner, appropriate for the business setting in which it will be used. The design must include both French and English language versions. </p>
      <h2 class="micro push-none">The Solution</h2>
      <p>Inspired by children’s first-words books and their bright bold colors, oversized fonts, and big simple illustrations, these elements were applied into this design of the report. The varying differences in font sizes and alignment convey a childlike playfulness, without compromising information flow, aesthetic consistency and legibility.To maintain the simplicity of the design, the report is limited to 3 primary colors, two of which are the brand colors, which alternate with every section,making them easily identifiable and dynamic, yet consistent to
the design.</p>
