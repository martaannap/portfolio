    <h2 class="micro push-none">The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Redesign existing packaging for a more environmentally friendly alternative. </p>
    <h2 class="micro push-none">The Solution</h2>
    <p>The current tin packaging is replaced with 100% compostable paper coffee bags with a high barrier polypropylene liner. Based on this material, the prototype was created and coupled with a new label that visually matches the environmental goals of the company. Not to compromise reconcilability of the brand, familiar elements and colors were included in the labels for a more contemporary and premium feel. The 100% biodegradable coffee bag is accompanied by a tag that informs customers that they are using an earth-friendly bag and includes tips on proper composting methods. This new design will allow Maxwell House to break into the premium coffee market, and stand out on the shelves.</p>
